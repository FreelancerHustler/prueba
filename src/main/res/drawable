The `src/main/res/drawable` directory is typically used to store images and other drawable resources for an Android application. However, as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to create images or graphical resources. 

In a real-world scenario, you would place your image files (like .png, .jpg, .xml etc.) in this directory. For example, you might have images for the seafood dishes, ocean-inspired elements, and other UI elements. 

Please note that the actual creation and addition of these image files would be done by a graphic designer or a UI/UX designer, and these files would be binary in nature, not something that can be generated through text-based code.
